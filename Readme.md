# WinForms Ribbon - MDI Ribbon merge

This example demonstrates automatic menu merging for MDI applications. The main and child MDI forms contain a Ribbon UI. The child form's `RibbonControl` is merged into the main form's RibbonControl when the child form is maximized.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevExpress-Examples/how-to-merge-ribbon-controls-e1917/13.1.4%2B/media/winforms-ribbon-merge-mdi.png)

```csharp
private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) {
    ribbonControl1.MdiMergeStyle = RibbonMdiMergeStyle.OnlyWhenMaximized;
    CreateChildForm();
}
```
